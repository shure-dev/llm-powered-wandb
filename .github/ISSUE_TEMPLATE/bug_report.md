## Bug Description
- Provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.
1) The dependencies are declining due to the specified versions when installing from the `requirements.txt`. I suggest removing them to prevent unseen errors, that would install the latest version for each dependencies.

2) File "/Users/jake/vscode/logllm-1/logllm/log_llm.py", line 3, in <module>
    from .extractor import extract_notebook_code
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
solution: remove the dot --> `from extractor import extract_notebook_code`

3) "logllm" is not defined [Ln 85, Col 5] on `test_logger.py` file 
solution: refactor to `    test_logllm(str(notebook_file), "api_key", "sample_notebook.ipynb")` 

4) ![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-08-24 at 11.35.33â€¯PM.png>) 
solution: I havent figured it out has something to do with `_init_.py` Question: What does the `_init_.py` does?
